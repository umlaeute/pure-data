This is a test to see how ugly it would be to simply make the needed
gtk bindings to tcl so that we can run Pd with a GTK front end. This might
turn out to be the best way to support 'wayland' (which linux is migrating to).


To test:

make && pd -guicmd ~/pd/gtk/pdgtk -nrt -stderr test1.pd

Set the DEBUG environment variable to enable debugging printout.

So far, one can click on things, go into and out of edit
mode, move boxes around and/or type into them.

There are about 10 tcl commands that get parsed.  The Pd source has
325 calls to pdgui_vmess / pdgui_vamess, of which perhaps 100 or 200
are distinct.

At the moment I'm modifying the pdgui calls, one by one, to replace things
like

   [...] create line [...] -fill #000000

with

   pdtk_canvas_create_line #00000 [...]

and adding functions like pdtk_canvas_create_line to the tcl code, so that
it becomes easier to parse the tcl commands from the gtk end.

todo next:
text editing for objects etc - manage and show text selection
finish replacing "create line" with pdtk_canvas_create_line calls
add copy, paste, delete
put in menus and text buffer in main window

ideas:
can some or all of the many dialog windows be re-implemented as Pd patches?
(see how Max does it... this would make it much easier to adapt to any future
GUI implementations.)
