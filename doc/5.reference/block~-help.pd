#X text 39 375 Pd's default block size is 64 samples. The inlet~ and
outlet~ objects reblock signals to adjust for differences between parent
and subpatch \, but only power-of-two adjustments are possible. So
for "normal" audio computations \, all blocks should also be power-of-two
in size. HOWEVER \, if you have no inlet~ or outlet~ you may specify
any other block size. This is intended for later use in video processing.

dac~ or adc~ is reblocked back to the default block size and sample

#X text 33 209 Patches using send~/receive~ or throw~/catch~ to intercommunicate
must have the same blocking -- and if their parents are blocked bigger
than they are \, there might be weirdness.;
#X text 31 128 If using send~ or delwrite~ from a switched-off patch
\, the output of corresponding receive~ and delread~ objects in other
\, running patches will cycle old input (and sound like garbage). Throw~
may be switched with impunity \, but not catch~.;
