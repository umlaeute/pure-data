#X text 574 495 BUG: The name "-stdpath" is confusing \, as it has
a quite different effect from "-stdpath" on the pd command line.,

#X text 559 394 WARNING: as of version 0.47 \, "declare -path" and
"declare -stdpath" inside abstractions take effect only within those
abstractions. If Pd's compatibility version is set to 0.46 or earlier
the old (buggy) behavior takes effect., f 47;

#X text 29 372 For instance \, if you put abstractions and/or other
supporting files in a subdirectory "more" \, you can put an object
"declare -path more" to make sure Pd sees them when the patch is loaded.
Or \, if you have files installed in the directory extra/stillmore
(in the Pd installation) you can get it using "declare -stdpath stillmore".

#X text 546 97 It is a current best practice to just use [declare]
instead of permanently adding paths to the user search paths or libs
to startup. With [declare] you can better manage and avoid conflicts
with externals from different libraries that have the same name by
using it to call the right library you want., f 74;

#X text 27 170 A declare object adds one or more directories to the
search path \, and/or pre-loads one or more libraries ("externals")
to Pd in preparation for opening the patch from a file. Usage is "declare
[-flag value] [-flag value] ..." where the flag can be:, f 69;
#X text 29 333 (For any of these you may use a full pathname such as
"/tmp/dir" or \, in Windows \, "C:/garbage" instead of a relative path).
, f 68;
#X text 27 44 Compiled external libraries come either as a single binary
pack (the "classic" library format) or as a set of separate binaries
and/or abstractions. A single binary pack is what we refer to as a
'library' and needs to be pre loaded - wheres external libraries that
have separate binaries/abstractions must be loaded by simply adding
its directory to the search path. Adding a directory to the path is
also needed if you want to load things like audio and text files that
are in it., f 69;
#X text 29 452 Paths declared with '-path' will have top search priority.
Next priority is the relative path \, then user added search paths
(set in "Preferences => Path") and finally the standard path (a.k.a
the 'extra' folder). As of version 0.49 \, "declare -path" and "declare
-lib" will fall back the other search paths if the relative path to
the patch does not exist. To avoid checking further \, use an explicit
relative path by prepending "./" or "../" to the path or lib name.
, f 68;
#X text 546 30 Since the 'extra' folder is the last in the search priority
\, other paths are searched before. You can use [declare -stdpath ./]
to ensure that 'extra' has search priority. Note that the order you
specify '-path' flags also specify the search priority., f 74;
#X text 547 172 However \, note that when a library (with 'declare
-lib' or via startup) \, all of its objects get pre loaded \, so using
'declare -path' cannot enforce search priority. Hence \, you may neeed
to adopt slash declarations as in [library/objeectname]. Note also
that while '-path' will only add search paths for the patch that owns
the [declare] object \, once a library is loaded \, it stays with Pd
and will be able to be loaded in other patches without [declare]. For
more details on this and how external loading works in Pd \, please
refer to the chapter 4 of Pd's manual., f 74;
