#X text 32 72 Output~ takes a stereo signal and has GUI controls to
set the volume game and mute it. The number box sets the output gain
in dB (from 0 to 100) and whenever you click on it to drag \, the DSP
engine is turned on. The mute bang turns the volume off (sets to 0)
but restores the last setting when you click back on it to unmute.
